#### By _**Liam Kenna**_

## Description

_This app is an exercise in building a webpack dev environment and using modular JS. The initial form accepts a users age, gender, and health(1-10), then calculates all data when creating a user object.  The data available for Mercury, Mars, Venus, and Jupiter includes:_

* _Age in planetary years_
* _Life expectancy in planetary years_
* _Expected planetary years left to live_

_For example:_

| Input:  | Output:   |
|---|---|
|age:20, gender:N, health:7|age on Mars: 10 years|
|age:20, gender:N, health:7|life expectancy on Venus: 143 years|

_Additionally, clicking on the sun will provide a users age relative to the age of the sun and relative to the lifespan of a mayfly._
